# Supplementary material for the paper by Verso et al. "Inertial particles crossing finite stratified interface layer"

This repository contains the Matlab (Mathworks Inc.) code that models a trajectory of an inertial particle crossing the interface. 

There are 5 types of particles, P1-P4 and PF

To run the code open the file `particle.m`, change the value of `flag` from 1 to 5 and `Run`
